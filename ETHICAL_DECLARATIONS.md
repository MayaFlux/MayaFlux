## Attribution & Cultural Identity

The name **MayaFlux** is rooted in the Sanskrit concept of _Māyā_ (माया), referring to illusion, appearance, and the dynamic shaping of reality — a foundational principle in various schools of Indian philosophy. This project embraces and reinterprets these concepts through computational and generative systems design. Majority of the namespaces within the code reinterpret a network of related Sanskrit terminology for contextual and aesthetical descriptions, including but not limited to Lila, Yantra, Vruta, Kakshya, Vidhi etc.

The usage of this term is not incidental but intentional, reflecting the philosophical and cultural heritage of its author and origin. MayaFlux was created by a South Asian developer as an extension of inherited cultural frameworks, and stands in continuity with those traditions.

Any attempt to appropriate, commercialize, or monopolize the term _Maya_ (or _MayaFlux_) divorced from its cultural context — particularly by entities with no historical or cultural stake in it — will be treated as an act of erasure and misrepresentation.

This statement does not impose restrictions beyond the GPLv3 license, but serves as a cultural marker against historical patterns of appropriation and intellectual extraction.
