# Contributing to MayaFlux

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **MayaFlux**!
This project is built on the principles of open knowledge, equitable access, and collaborative development.
By participating, you agree to abide by the **GPLv3 license** and the guidelines below.

## 🧩 Contribution Philosophy

1. **Open Source First**
   All contributions must remain open and compatible with GPLv3.
   No proprietary or NDA-bound work can be merged.

2. **Shared Credit**
   All contributors are acknowledged in release notes, `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, and Git history.
   Attribution and citation are integral to how MayaFlux recognizes effort.

3. **Public Benefit**
   Contributions should advance the public, creative, or technical potential of digital media systems.
   This project exists to empower creators, not gatekeep technology.

4. **Technical Integrity**
   MayaFlux adheres to real-time safety, cross-platform correctness, and compositional clarity.
   PRs that violate these principles may be deferred until restructured.

## 🔧 Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature, fix, or document.
3. **Commit cleanly** — prefer focused commits with descriptive messages.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** containing:

   * A summary of what was done and why
   * Notes on testing (especially for real-time or platform-critical changes)
   * References to any algorithms, papers, or external code used

PRs are reviewed for technical clarity, conceptual alignment, and code safety.

## 🤝 Communication & Etiquette

* Use Issues or Discussions for questions before starting major work.

## 🪜 Where to Start

If you’re new, begin with:
